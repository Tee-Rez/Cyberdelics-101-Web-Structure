                            Alex has been hearing about <strong>cyberdelic experiences</strong> from colleagues.
                            A friend just offered to lend them a VR headset with a consciousness exploration app
                            installed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Alex has never tried VR before and feels both excited and nervous.
                            They have a free Saturday afternoon and are considering trying it.
                        </p>

                            All three approaches have merit, but <strong>preparation matters</strong> in cyberdelic
                            experiences.
                            Understanding set (mindset) and setting (environment) significantly impacts the quality of
                            the experience.

                            Alex decides to prepare properly. They've cleared their afternoon,
                            turned off notifications, and are ready to set up the experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Looking around their apartment, Alex considers where to use the VR headset.

                            <strong>Setting matters deeply</strong> in cyberdelic work. A private, controlled

                            where you won't be interrupted allows for deeper immersion. The bedroom option demonstrates

                            Alex puts on the headset in their quiet bedroom. The app begins with calming visuals
                            and a guided breathing exercise. After a few minutes, the experience becomes more immersive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Suddenly, Alex feels a wave of <strong>unexpected emotion</strong> — a mix of awe and
                            slight anxiety as the boundaries of their normal perception begin to shift.

                            <strong>Working with difficult emotions</strong> is a core skill in consciousness work.
                            Option B demonstrates the balanced approach: neither fleeing from nor forcing through
                            intensity.
                            Breath awareness and gentle acceptance often allow experiences to unfold naturally.
                            That said, knowing when to stop is also a valuable skill.
