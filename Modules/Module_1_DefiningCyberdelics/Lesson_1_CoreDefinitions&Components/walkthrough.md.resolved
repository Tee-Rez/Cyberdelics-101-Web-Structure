## Implementation Details

### Teaching Method Structure

All manifests follow the established JSON structure:
```javascript
export default {
  "title": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "theme": { "primaryColor": "#5900ff", "fontBody": "Rajdhani, sans-serif" },
  "modules": [ /* teaching method modules */ ],
  "artifacts": []
}
```

### Progressive Disclosure Format

Each progressive disclosure module contains:
- `sections` array with title, content, and triggerLabel
- Optional `image` objects with AI prompts embedded as comments
- Image positioning: left, right, or full-width

### Quiz Structure

Quiz modules include:
- Scenario-based questions with real-world context
- 4 options per question (A, B, C, D)
- Wrong answer feedback that teaches concepts
- Correct answer advancement logic
- Retry loops for wrong answers
- Navigation to next mini-lesson on completion

### Interactive Placeholders

Undesigned interactive methods use simple `simple-display` type with:
- Warning emoji and clear placeholder title
- Detailed description of planned functionality
- Design notes for future implementation

### AI Image Integration

Total: **9 AI images** across all mini-lessons

Each image includes:
- `src`: placeholder filename
- `alt`: descriptive alt text
- `position`: left, right, or full-width
- `aiPrompt`: detailed generation prompt
- Inline comment above with prompt for quick reference
