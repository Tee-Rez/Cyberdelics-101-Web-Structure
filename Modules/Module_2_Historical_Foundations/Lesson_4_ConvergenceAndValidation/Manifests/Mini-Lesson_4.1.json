    "title": "The COVID Catalyst",
    "description": "Just as cyberdelics was emerging from its 30-year journey, an unexpected accelerant arrived: a global pandemic. COVID-19's social isolation forced rapid cultural adaptation that might have taken years otherwise. You'll discover how lockdowns drove millions to buy VR headsets, how virtual gatherings suddenly became essential rather than optional, and how cultural attitudes about technology-mediated experience shifted dramatically in months. This wasn't just about VR sales numbers—it was about the fundamental question of whether connection through technology can be real. The pandemic answered: yes.",

The pandemic normalized using technology for mental health and consciousness work. By late 2020, the cultural conditions were perfect: millions owned VR headsets, virtual gathering was normalized, mental health tech was mainstream, technology for consciousness was accepted, and people had time and space to explore.",
