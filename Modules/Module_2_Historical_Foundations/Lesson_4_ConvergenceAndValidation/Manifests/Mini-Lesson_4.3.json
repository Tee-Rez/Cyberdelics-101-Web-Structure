    "description": "The Isness study showed subjective mystical experiences were real. But what about the brain? Additional research demonstrated that VR-induced altered states produced measurable neural changes similar to psychedelic substances and meditation. You'll discover how DeepDream VR created psychedelic-like visual distortions that changed brain activity patterns, how EEG studies showed increased neural entropy and flexibility, and how these findings proved VR doesn't just create illusions—it genuinely alters consciousness in measurable ways. This neural evidence completed the scientific validation, showing cyberdelics works at both experiential and biological levels.",

The concept: if psychedelics produce visual distortions through affecting visual processing, could artificially creating similar distortions produce similar consciousness changes? Participants described experiences as 'psychedelic-like,' with visual patterns similar to substance experiences, and some couldn't distinguish from mild psychedelic experiences.",
