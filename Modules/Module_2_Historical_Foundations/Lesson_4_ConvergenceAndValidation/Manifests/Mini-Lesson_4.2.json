    "title": "The Breakthrough—Isness VR Study",
    "description": "After 30 years, the validation finally arrived. In June 2020, researchers published proof of what Timothy Leary had predicted in 1994: technology could produce mystical experiences comparable to psychedelics. This wasn't opinion or anecdote—it was rigorous peer-reviewed research using the same validated measures psychedelic researchers used. The Isness VR study transformed cyberdelics from vision to validated science. You'll see exactly what they found, how they measured it, and why this single study changed everything for the field's credibility and future.",
