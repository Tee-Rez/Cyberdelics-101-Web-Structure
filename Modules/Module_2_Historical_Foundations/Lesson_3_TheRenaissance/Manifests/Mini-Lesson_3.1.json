His key insights: smartphone displays had gotten good enough with high resolution, high refresh rates, and cheap manufacturing. Phone sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes) could track head movement accurately. Clever lens design could create wide field of view from small screens. Make it affordable by using mass-market components. His prototype, held together with duct tape, actually worked with 90+ degree field of view, low latency head tracking, decent image quality, and potential sub-$300 cost.</p>",
