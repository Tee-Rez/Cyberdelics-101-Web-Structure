Created by former Buddhist monk Andy Puddicombe, it offered guided meditations in 10-minute sessions, gamified progress tracking, beautiful friendly interfaces, and subscription models. By 2015, Headspace had millions of users—people who would have said meditation was \"too hippie\" were now paying $10/month for an app guiding their practice. Calm (2012) followed quickly, emphasizing sleep stories, nature sounds, and minimalist design. By 2019, Calm was valued at $1 billion—the first meditation \"unicorn.\"</p>",

These limitations created opportunity: what if you could combine meditation app accessibility with VR's immersive power, fully engaging attention, enabling social practice, and offering progressive depth?</p>",
